# Hotel-Booking-Analytics---Cancellation-Prediction-Project

This project analyzes 119k+ hotel booking records to uncover insights related to customer behavior, seasonality, pricing patterns, and cancellation dynamics.
The workflow includes:

- SQL-based data cleaning & preprocessing
- Feature engineering (dates, stay length, lead time, guest segmentation)
- KPI modeling
- Power BI dashboard development
- Analytical storytelling via PDF report & PPT presentation

# Project Objectives

- Clean and prepare raw hotel booking data using SQL

- Analyze booking trends, cancellations, guest behavior & revenue drivers

- Build KPIs to evaluate hotel performance

- Develop a fully interactive Power BI dashboard

- Present insights and strategic recommendations for stakeholders

# Dataset Details

- Dataset includes key booking attributes such as:

- Customer demographics (adults, children, babies)

- Dates (arrival date, booking date, reservation status date)

- Stay details (weekend & week nights)

- Pricing (ADR – average daily rate)

- Lead time & special requests

- Booking source (agent/company/direct)

- Market segment & distribution channel

- Cancellation & reservation status

<h3><b>Dataset File:</b></h3>

All datasets used in this project (main cleaned dataset + 3 lookup tables) are available in a single zipped file:  

🔗 **[Hotel_booking_Datasets.zip](./Dataset/Hotel_booking_Datasets.zip)**  


# SQL Cleaning & Transformation Workflow

- The SQL file includes:

- Null handling & fixing inconsistent values

- Adding booking source, flags & enriched attributes

- Deriving features:

  <pre>arrival_date

  reservation_status_dt

  stay_length

  guest_count

  booking_date

  season classification

  Detecting anomalies</pre>

- KPI calculations (Booking Volume, Revenue, Cancellations, Lead Time etc.)

 SQL File:
- **SQL Script:** [hotel_project_final.sql](./SQL/hotel_project_final.sql)


# Power BI Dashboard

Dashboard contains:

<h3><b>1. Booking Performance Overview</b></h3>

- Total bookings, cancellations, returning users

- Seasonal & monthly booking trends

- Lead time distribution

- ADR patterns (overall, by hotel, by month)

<h3><b>2️. Revenue Analysis</b></h3>

- Realized vs unrealized revenue

- Revenue by year, season, hotel type

<h3><b>3. Customer Behavior</b></h3>

- Guest count segmentation

- LOS (length of stay)

- Bookings with special requests

<h3><b>4️. Cancellation Intelligence</b></h3>

- Cancellation trends by year

- Cancellation rate by lead-time bucket

- Market segment & country-level cancellation heatmaps

# Reports & Presentation
<b>Final Report (PDF)</b>

Includes complete analysis summary, KPIs, and insights.

# Key Insights (Summary)
<h3><b>Booking Performance</b></h3>

- City Hotel receives higher bookings but also higher cancellations

- High seasonality observed — summer peak

- Lead time strongly impacts cancellation rate

<h3><b>Revenue Insights</b></h3>

- Highest revenue generated in peak holiday months

- Resort Hotel yields higher ADR than City Hotel

<h3><b>Guest Behavior</b></h3>

- Majority of bookings made for 2-person stays

- Families prefer Resort Hotel

- Higher stay length = higher realized revenue

<h3><b>Cancellation Findings</b></h3>

- Long lead-time bookings show the highest cancellations

- Some markets & countries show disproportionately high cancellation rates

- Potential lost revenue is significant → key opportunity area

#  Strategic Recommendations

- Optimization Opportunities

- Improve cancellation policy for long lead time segments

- Enhance pricing strategy for high-demand seasons

- Promote off-season packages

- Personalize marketing for repeat guests

- Optimize waiting list & ADR variance

- Customer Experience

- Provide better offers for family travelers

- Introduce loyalty program for reducing cancellations
